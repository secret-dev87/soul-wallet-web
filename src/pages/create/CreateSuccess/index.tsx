                This Public Alpha Testing Disclaimer ("Disclaimer") pertains to the use of Soul Wallet in its alpha version. The purpose of this Disclaimer is to inform users ("Participants") that the current version of Soul Wallet is an alpha release, and as such, it should be used with the understanding that it is a preliminary product undergoing rigorous testing and refinement. Participants acknowledge that they engage with the product at their own risk.

                Soul Wallet epitomizes the forefront of smart contract wallet technology, providing enhanced security, a user-friendly interface, and integrated decentralized application (dApp) interaction. Its distinct features aim to streamline user transactions and interactions within the Ethereum network, emphasizing ease of access and robust security protocols.

              <Heading1 marginTop="20px">Acknowledgment of Alpha Status</Heading1>
              <TextBody fontSize="16px" fontWeight="500">
                Participants acknowledge that they are engaging with Soul Wallet in its alpha stageâ€”a preliminary phase of development provided expressly for testing and feedback purposes. This early release may not be free of imperfections and by participating, users accept the inherent risks of using software that is still in its formative stages. The alpha testing phase is conducted solely on a designated testnet, allowing participants to simulate transactions with test tokens. This crucial stage is aimed at gathering extensive user feedback, which is vital for refining the wallet prior to the anticipated mainnet launch.

                While the Soul Wallet team is committed to ensuring the highest quality and security standards, we cannot guarantee that the alpha version will be free from defects or errors. By agreeing to participate in this testing phase, Participants assume all risks related to the use of the alpha version, and our company shall not be liable for any harm, loss, or damage of any kind arising from its use.

                Participants should be aware that as Soul Wallet undergoes development and continuous updates, temporary lapses in functionality may occur. These interruptions are expected during the software iteration process and should only raise concerns if they last longer than three days, at which point they should be reported as a potential bug. Additionally, it's important to note that wallet balances could be reset during updates, and it is prudent to avoid transferring significant value into the wallet during the test phase.

Any actions taken within the alpha version, whether transacting, inputting data, or other forms of use, fall under the participant's responsibility. To mitigate risk, it is advised against moving any considerable assets or sensitive personal information into the wallet for the duration of this alpha testing period.
